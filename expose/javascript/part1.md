### q1 
Line 9 prints 'values added: 20'

### q2
Line 13 prints 'final result: 20'

### q3 
Line 9 prints 'values added: 20'

### q4
Line 13 will return a error, it is because the scope of variable 'result' is within the 'if' scope.
If we call the variable outside the scope, it will be treated as a undefined variable.

### q5 
Line 9 will reutrn an error. It is because we cannot reassign a constant variable's value

### q6
Since the code return an error before line 13, line 13 will print nothing. However, if we 
assume the code did not enter the first "if-else", line 13 will return 0.
